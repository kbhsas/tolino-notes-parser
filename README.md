# Tolino Notes Parser (Working Title)
The Tolino E-Reader saves highlighted text and notes in an unwieldy `notes.txt` file. So the purpose of this project is to parse this file and export the data
in markdown format.

But once the data is injested, further functionality and output formats would be easy to implement.

## Usage

The input file is hard-coded (`notes.txt`) right now and the script doesn't do much.
``` bash
python main.py
```
