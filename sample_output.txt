			- > The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again.

There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was a beginning.

			  > It didn’t reach it.

					   this is a multiline note with possible weird white space in the highlighted text.
